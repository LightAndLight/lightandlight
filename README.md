## About Me

*He/Him*

I'm a 26 year old software developer living in Brisbane, Australia.

I enjoy building things that make people more effective. I'm particularly passionate about
developer tooling because it contributes to a cycle of self improvement within software development.

## Projects

My 'academic' roots lie in programming language theory and type theory. As a result, all of my biggest
personal projects have been programming languages. See my 'pinned' repositories for
a selection of my favourite projects.
